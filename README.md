# NewFloat-Representation
This project implements a custom floating-point representation called `NewFloat` in C. The `NewFloat` type is designed to convert, add, double, and debug floating-point numbers using bitwise operations. The implementation includes several key functions to facilitate these operations.

## Features

- **Bit String to NewFloat Conversion**: Convert a 32-character binary string into a `NewFloat` representation.
- **Float to NewFloat Conversion**: Convert standard floating-point numbers to `NewFloat`.
- **NewFloat Addition**: Perform addition between two `NewFloat` values.
- **Doubling a NewFloat**: Efficiently double the value of a `NewFloat`.
- **Debugging Functionality**: Display the internal bit representation of a `NewFloat`.
